## Inspiration
The GROW study method is a popular approach to learning that helps students set goals, track their progress, and stay motivated. As students ourselves, we are all too familiar with the difficulty in balancing studying a wide range of topics--- we often find ourselves either over or understudying topics for exams. GROW has proved to be an effective study technique for us! However, we found that there was no formalized application that implemented this study technique (people typically handwrite out grids or use Google sheets). By creating this app, we could raise awareness to this technique, as well as make it more accessible. Moreover, we wanted to create an application that we would be end-users of and one that could drive positive impact!

## What it does
StudySprout is an app that implements the GROW study method in a fun and accessible way! The user can add upcoming exams (as well as dates), and for each of those exams, the app will create a customizable "grid" feature that will allow the user to visualize their studying progress. Before the exam, the user will set their goals by outlining the topics they intend to master. Afterwards, on the day they choose to review a certain topic, they can record the date. After studying that topic, the user can go back and color code the box according to their confidence in that topic (on a scale from 0-1). The goal is to continue reviewing the less-confident concepts and, ultimately, achieve all score-1 boxes (full mastery!). The instructions may seem confusing at first but, (don't fret!) we included a user-friendly informational guide that outlines the steps. Lastly, as a bonus: After each exam, the user has the option to "archive" their exam, and with each archive the user receives a "seed" to plant a tree in their personal forest!

## How we built it
We determined the basic frame design with “Figma”” and user-flow with “SwiftStoryboard.” We used **Swift** as the front-end framework and **UIkit** as the interfacing tool to build an iOS-style mobile application.
